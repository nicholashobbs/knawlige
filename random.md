to write a kernel to run bare metal rust on raspberry pi, 

build cross compiler for target platform

write a kernel that can be compiled with cross compiler

kernel needs to be able to interact with hardware such as uart gpio. It should also have memory management and a scheduler to manage execution of processes

write a bootloader that can be compiled with cross compiler

in embedded programming, you need to know addresses to interact with to do things on the chip


Peaks.js is an open-source JavaScript library for rendering and interacting with audio waveforms in a web browser. It provides a flexible and customizable interface for visualizing audio data, and supports a wide range of features such as zooming, selection, and annotation.

To use Peaks.js in your project, you can include the library in your HTML file and create a Peaks instance, passing in the configuration options for your waveform:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Peaks.js Demo</title>
  <script src="peaks.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="waveform-container"></div>
  <script>
    var options = {
      container: document.getElementById('waveform-container'),
      mediaElement: document.getElementById('audio'),
      dataUri: {
        arraybuffer: 'audio-file.mp3'
      }
    };
    var peaks = Peaks.init(options);
  </script>
  <audio id="audio" src="audio-file.mp3" preload="auto"></audio>
</body>
</html>
In this example, we create a Peaks instance with a container element, an HTML5 audio element, and a dataUri pointing to an audio file. We then pass this configuration object to the Peaks.init() method, which initializes the Peaks instance and renders the waveform in the specified container.

Peaks.js provides various methods and events for working with the waveform and accessing data, such as zoom(), getSegments(), and on(). You can find more code examples and detailed documentation on the official GitHub repository for Peaks.js.
