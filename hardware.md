Logic gates: The book starts by introducing the basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT), and shows how they can be used to build more complex circuits, such as adders and multipliers.

Combinational logic: The book then moves on to combinational logic circuits, which take inputs and produce outputs based on the current state of the inputs. Students learn about Boolean algebra, truth tables, and how to design and build combinational logic circuits.

Sequential logic: The book covers sequential logic circuits, which have memory and can store data over time. Students learn about flip-flops, clock signals, and how to design and build sequential logic circuits.

Computer architecture: The book then introduces the basic architecture of a computer system, including the CPU, memory, and input/output devices. Students learn about the von Neumann architecture, which is used in most modern computer systems.

Machine language: The book covers machine language, the lowest-level programming language used by computers. Students learn how to write simple programs in machine language, and how to use machine language to control the computer's hardware.

Assembler: The book introduces the concept of an assembler, which translates assembly language programs into machine language. Students learn how to write assembly language programs, and how to use an assembler to convert those programs into machine language.

Memory: The book covers the concept of memory in a computer system, including the difference between registers and RAM. Students learn how to build memory circuits, and how to use memory to store and retrieve data.

CPU design: The book covers CPU design, including the fetch-decode-execute cycle and the design of the control unit. Students learn how to build a simple CPU using the logic gates and circuits they have already learned.

Operating systems: The book covers operating systems, including the boot process, file systems, and device drivers. Students learn about the different components of an operating system, and how those components work together to manage the computer's hardware and software.

High-level programming languages: The book introduces high-level programming languages, such as Jack, which is a simple object-oriented language designed specifically for the course. Students learn how to write programs in Jack, and how to use a compiler to convert those programs into machine language.

Virtual machines: The book covers the concept of a virtual machine, which is a software implementation of a computer system. Students learn how to build a virtual machine, and how to use that virtual machine to run programs written in Jack.

Compilation: The book covers the process of compilation, including lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation. Students learn about the different stages of compilation, and how compilers work to translate high-level programming languages into machine language.

## graphics cards

maxwell, pascal, volta, turing, ampere ada lovelace are the names of the gpu architectures

tsmc vs samsung nm process

texture mappiung units
render output units

rtx is ray tracing and rt cores are the ray tracing units

tensor cores run ai upscaling like dlss

memory on the gpu is gddr 

the amount of memory on the gpu affects applications that use a lot of memory like deep learning

chips are categorized by the amount of transistors which are not defective, those which have more defects are binned

BIN refers to the quality of the chip

L2 cache is a type of memory used by GPUs to store frequently used data and instructions. It is located between the GPU core and the GPU’s main memory, and is much faster than the main memory. This helps the GPU access data quickly, improving overall performance.

tdp is the maximum amount of power the gpu can use, in the latest graphics cards up to 450 watts, however performance is similar at a lower tdp

chiplet architecture is where the gpu is split into multiple chips, this allows for more transistors and more memory

shader units are the units that do the actual computation

teraflops is the number of floating point operations per second

navi 31 is the architecture of the 7900xt

tsv connection points are the points where the gpu connects to the memory

cache is a type of memory that is faster than main memory, it is used to store frequently used data and instructions

boost clock is the maximum clock speed of the gpu

 l2 cache is a type of memory used by GPUs to store frequently used data and instructions. It is located between the GPU core and the GPU’s main memory, and is much faster than the main memory

 l3 cache in comparison to l2 cache is slower but has more space
